Customer Segmentation using K-Means and PCA
This project performs customer segmentation using unsupervised machine‑learning techniques. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior and numerical attributes.

Project Overview
The workflow includes:

Data loading and preprocessing
Handling missing values and scaling
Dimensionality reduction using PCA
Clustering with K-Means
Selecting the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method
Visualizing cluster distribution and interpreting insights
Methods
PCA was used to reduce dimensionality and improve cluster separability.
K-Means identified meaningful customer groups for marketing and business strategy.
Visualizations help explain how customers differ across segments.
Key Skills Demonstrated
Unsupervised learning
Exploratory data analysis
Feature engineering
PCA and clustering
Data visualization and business interpretation
This project represents an end‑to‑end machine‑learning pipeline applicable to real‑world customer analytics.
